I have atempted to create a personal finance calculator on solidity.
This calculator takes inputs of your expenses such as rent, food, clothing and other expense and gives you your total expenses. It similarly calculates your total income by adding up your salary and returns from your investment. 
This calculator can be used to calculate your daily expenses and income to keep a track record and since its deployed on blockchain, it is immutable and would help you to maintain a record of your personal finances.
